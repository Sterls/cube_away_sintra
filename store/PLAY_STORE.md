# Getting Whoosh Blocks onto Google Play

Everything needed for the Play Store: the steps, the listing text and the
answers to Google's forms. Images are in this folder:

## Step 1. Google Play developer account (you)

1. Go to <https://play.google.com/console> and sign in with the game's Gmail.
2. Choose **Personal** account, pay the US$25 fee, and complete identity
   verification (photo ID) and Android device verification.
3. Verification can take a few days. Carry on with step 2 meanwhile.

## Step 2. Build the Android app with PWABuilder (you, about 10 minutes)

1. Open <https://www.pwabuilder.com>, paste `https://sterls.github.io/whoosh_blocks/`
   and press **Start**.
2. Click **Package for stores** → **Android** → **Generate package**, then
   open **All settings** and set:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Package ID | `io.github.sterls.whooshblocks` (permanent, can never change) |
   | App name | `Whoosh Blocks` |
   | Launcher name | `Whoosh` |
   | App version / version code | `1.0.0` / `1` |
   | Display mode | `Standalone` |
   | Status bar colour / Splash colour | `#EFE9FF` |
   | Signing key | **Create new** |

3. Download the zip. It contains:
   - `*.aab`: the app to upload to Play,
   - `signing.keystore` and `signing-key-info.txt`: **your signing key and passwords**,
   - `assetlinks.json`: needed for step 5.
4. **Back up the whole zip somewhere safe**, e.g. a password manager or private
   cloud storage. You need the key for every future update. **Never put it in this
   repo**, because the repo is public.

## Step 3. Create the app in Play Console (you)

1. **Create app**: name `Whoosh Blocks`, language English (United Kingdom),
   **Game**, **Free**. Accept the declarations.
2. Keep **Play App Signing** on (the default). Google then holds the final
   signing key, so a lost upload key can be reset.
3. Fill in the store listing and forms with the text below.

## Step 4. Closed test, 14 days (you plus 12 testers)

1. **Test and release → Testing → Closed testing → Create track.**
2. Upload the `.aab` from step 2 and roll out the release.
3. Add **at least 12 testers** by email (Google accounts with Android phones)
   and send them the opt-in link. They must stay opted in for **14 days in a row**.
4. After 14 days, apply for **production access**. Google reviews it in a few
   days, then you publish to production.

## Step 5. Make the app open full-screen (you + me)

Android hides the browser bar only if the website confirms it owns the app.
That proof file must live at `https://sterls.github.io/.well-known/assetlinks.json`,
the root of your GitHub Pages site, which needs one extra repo:

1. On GitHub, create a **public** repo named exactly **`Sterls.github.io`**
   (empty is fine) and tell me. I'll add the file.
2. Send me the two SHA-256 fingerprints, which are safe to share:
   - **upload key**: from `signing-key-info.txt` or PWABuilder's `assetlinks.json`,
   - **app signing key**: Play Console → **Test and release → App integrity
     → App signing** → "SHA-256 certificate fingerprint".
3. Until this is done, testers will see a thin address bar at the top. Everything
   else works.
